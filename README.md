Guava provides a wide range of useful classes, but some of the most important and commonly used ones include:

Lists, Sets, Maps, Collections2:

These utility classes provide convenient methods for creating and working with lists, sets, maps, and collections.
ImmutableList, ImmutableSet, ImmutableMap:

Immutable collection classes that guarantee the immutability of the underlying data structures, providing safety in concurrent environments.
Joiner and Splitter:

These classes offer easy-to-use methods for joining strings and splitting strings, respectively. They are helpful for constructing strings from collections or parsing strings into collections.
Function and Predicate:

These interfaces, along with related utility classes like Functions and Predicates, facilitate functional programming in Java. They are useful for transforming and filtering collections.
Optional:

The Optional class helps handle cases where a value may or may not be present. It encourages a more explicit approach to dealing with null values.
Preconditions:

The Preconditions class provides static methods to check preconditions for methods, making it easy to perform checks and throw exceptions when necessary.
CacheBuilder and Cache:

These classes help in creating and working with in-memory caches, providing features like expiration, eviction policies, and automatic loading of values.
Charsets and Bytes:

These classes provide constants for character sets and utility methods for working with byte arrays.
Range and Ranges:

These classes enable the creation and manipulation of ranges of comparable values, offering convenient methods for checking if a value is within a range.
Throwables:

This utility class provides methods for working with exceptions, including rethrowing, propagating, or wrapping exceptions.
