# Guava Utilities

This project demonstrates the usage of various utilities provided by Guava, a powerful open-source Java library developed by Google. Guava simplifies common programming tasks and enhances the functionality of the Java standard library.

## Project Structure

- `GuavaExample.java`: A Java file illustrating the use of Guava in common scenarios.
- `GuavaPredicateExample.java`: Another Java file showcasing Guava's predicates and collection filtering.

## Key Guava Classes

1. **Lists, Sets, Maps, Collections2:**
   - Utilities for working with lists, sets, maps, and collections.

2. **ImmutableList, ImmutableSet, ImmutableMap:**
   - Immutable collection classes ensuring immutability for safety in concurrent environments.

3. **Joiner and Splitter:**
   - Classes for easy string joining and splitting.

4. **Function and Predicate:**
   - Interfaces and utility classes for functional programming.

5. **Optional:**
   - Handling cases where a value may or may not be present.

6. **Preconditions:**
   - Checking preconditions for methods.

7. **CacheBuilder and Cache:**
   - Creating and working with in-memory caches.

8. **Charsets and Bytes:**
   - Constants and utilities for character sets and byte arrays.

9. **Range and Ranges:**
   - Creating and manipulating ranges of comparable values.

10. **Throwables:**
    - Utility methods for working with exceptions.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the example Java files to understand how to integrate and leverage Guava in your own projects. You can use these examples as a starting point for incorporating Guava utilities into your Java applications.
